# German_C1_C2_Vocab_Quiz

This is a simple Python Quiz application to help me memorize new vocabulary words for a C2 German exam. 
The Question Dictionary is currently unfinished, as is my study preparation for this exam. The dictionary will eventually have 100 questions. 
Some bugs in continuity of how I have worded the questions, how I have dealt with gender ambiguity in the German questions, some minor grammar that doesn't seem "native" enough, some things in the answer strings that lead to the authentication for the right answer being too strict, etc. need to be fixed as well. 
The plan is, once the 100 vocabulary words have been chosen and added to the dictionary, I will make smaller dictionaries based on subject or topic 
the word fits in and then separate quiz runners for each subject matter.
